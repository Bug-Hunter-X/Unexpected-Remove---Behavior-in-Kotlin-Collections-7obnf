This repository demonstrates a subtle difference in the behavior of the `remove()` function when applied to different Kotlin collection types (Lists, Sets, and Maps).  The example code shows that `remove()` operates differently for each collection type, highlighting a potential source of confusion and unexpected results for developers unfamiliar with these nuances.  The `bugSolution.kt` file provides a clear explanation and potential strategies for handling these differences depending on the desired functionality.
